# GeoPattern
This is a scala port of [btmills/geopattern](https://github.com/btmills/geopattern/), which is a JavaScript port of [jasonlong/geo_pattern](https://github.com/jasonlong/geo_pattern), which is derived from the background generator originally used for [GitHub Guides](http://guides.github.com/) because I have no idea how to read ruby.

- Only does the following shapes at the moment :)

# Why?
I just started learning Scala (basically just binge read [Programming in Scala](https://booksites.artima.com/programming_in_scala_3ed)) and wanted something to practice on.
